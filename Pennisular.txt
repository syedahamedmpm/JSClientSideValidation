Exercise #1: Online retail shop


Build an Online retail shop in Angular/Flutter/ any web framework of your choice where users can add and list products. Users should be able to order the available products. You can use the below API for products and order operations. We have enabled Swagger for your better understanding of API.

Exercise #2: Unit Testing
Write a 4-5 number of unit tests for your application for any of the modules. This exercise will be evaluated not based on the complexity of the test cases but on the elegance of how it is written. You should have used dependency injection in your application, so mock the dependencies.
